# CIS-5040---INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
Project Overview
Although demand for cybersecurity professionals is growing, organizations are struggling to find qualified applicants. In response to this shortage of cybersecurity professionals in the workforce, the IS 
department in the College of Business and Economics at Cal State LA is creating and building a cybersecurity program to contribute to the pipeline of qualified professionals. 
Its main goals include: 
a. establish a cybersecurity curriculum
b. develop competencies
c. meet academia and industry needs
d. increase student outreach and engagement

PROBLEM: How can we develop a cybersecurity program that engages students, IS department faculty, and industry professionals?
SOLUTION: Redesign the Cal State LA website to redefine the user experience upon landing on its home page. 
Navigating through the newly redesigned website should be intuitive. Students should be able to navigate to the cybersecurity page and access information related to faculty, clubs, and alumni networks.
